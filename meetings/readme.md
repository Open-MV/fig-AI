# OMF FIG Artificial Intelligence Meetings

## Meetings

Each FIG hosts a regular weekly meeting to update the community about the progress of the project and the FIG's contribution to the project. It is a recurring event to give everyone a chance to have their voice heard. The FIG holds its meetings each Thursday 12:30pm ET / 17:30 UTC / 6:30 PM CET.

Please [reach out on Discord](https://discord.gg/openmetaverse) or [Sign up on the Mailing Lists](https://lists.openmv.org/g/main) to get notifications for the recurring events.

## Who can Attend

Open Metaverse Foundation cannot work without the help and input from as many of its community members as possible. *You do not need anyoneâ€™s permission to get involved and contribute to the project.* The #artificial-intel channel on [OMF Discord](https://discord.gg/openmetaverse) is a great place to begin getting involved. Many of our community members regularly share ideas, updates, and resources there. You can also find a number of topics under the [OMF AI Groups](https://lists.openmv.org/g/fig-digitalassets/topics) which need your input.

## Agenda Items

You can find a link to the proposed agenda for the next call in the table below. The agenda for each meeting is saved as [a discussion on Github](https://github.com/openmetaverse/fig-ai/discussions/categories/meetings).

Please feel free to propose any of your topics, thoughts, or areas you feel are important to discuss.
